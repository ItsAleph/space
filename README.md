One package manager to rule 'em all

## DISCLAIMER

Like a lot of repos of mine, this project is currently **IDEA ONLY**. There's not even a prototype, just a skeleton, auto-generated "hello-world" project. If you want to work on it or steal it or dwyw with it - go ahead, but i'd greatly appreciate if you'll send me a notice about such.

## The idea itself

Just a convenient and beautiful wrapper over several package managers/installation methods available on an average archlinux installation, like: pacman, AUR, snap, flatpak, binary executable (.AppImage or whatever). It'll manage all these things in one place, suggesting the best options and doing lots of cool stuff you know you can imagine whatever and then suffer from not being able to do that and all..
